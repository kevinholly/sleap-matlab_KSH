# Multi-animal Pose Tracking using SLEAP in MATLAB

This repository contains an implementation and examples of how to use deep neural network models for pose estimation trained in [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai) to track multiple body parts of freely moving animals using the [MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html).
