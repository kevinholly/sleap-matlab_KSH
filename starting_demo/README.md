Starting Demo
=============

This demo illustrates how to run inference with a trained top-down multi-instance SLEAP model natively in MATLAB.

To run the demo, run the [`demo.mlx`](https://github.com/murthylab/sleap-matlab/tree/main/starting_demo/demo.mlx) from this folder. See [`demo.pdf`](https://github.com/murthylab/sleap-matlab/tree/main/starting_demo/demo.pdf) for a saved version of the outputs.

All data and supporting dependencies are included in the folder. This demo was tested on [MATLAB R2020b](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2020b/index.html) and requires the [Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2020b/images/index.html) and [Deep Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2020b/deeplearning/index.html).
